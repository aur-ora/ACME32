# ACME32
The goal of these projects is to build a working network infrastructure. \
For each one of the four assignments, it was needed to add some specific features and make some changes in the configuration in order to make everything work in the right way. \
The OPNsense FreeBSD-based firewall and routing platform was used for this purpose.
