# ACME32
The goal of these projects is to build a working network infrastructure. \
For each one of the four assignments, it was needed to add some specific features and make some changes in the configuration in order to make everything work in the right way. \
The OPNsense FreeBSD-based firewall and routing platform was used for this purpose. \
\
First assignment: Setup of the infrastructure for IPv6 addressing, DNS configuration, and Security Policy Enforcement (Firewall rules). \
\
Second assignment: Setup of the VPN for an internal tunnel and setup of Road Warriors.\
\
Third assignment: Forward Proxy configuration and Reverse Proxy configuration. \
\
Fourth assignment: Configuration of the Log Server and configuration of a log inside a client (Kali). \
